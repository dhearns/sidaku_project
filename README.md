# sidaku_project

This is a project for my final thesis.
I developed a web back-end system for a cooperatives and SMEs website under Pusat Layanan Usaha Terpadu Koperasi-Usaha Mikro, Kecil dan Menengah (PLUT-KUMKM) Kota Batu, named SIDAKU.
The purpose of developing this system is to automate the administration and save the important data of cooperatives and SMEs in Kota Batu and give public access to visitors who want to know more about cooperatives and SMEs in Kota Batu.
Not only for those purposes, in this project, I also made a features for SMEs' owner to analyze their SMEs (bullwhip effect and average supplier performance) by collaborating with some friends from Faculty of Agricultural Technology.
However, this code did not used by PLUT-KUMKM, this code is only for my final thesis.
